The macro runs on a workbook of stock data. The sheets need to formatted as ticker, date, open price, high, low, close price, volume for columns, and should be sorted by ticker symbol, then by date. 

On each spreadsheet,  the macro creates a table of ticker symbols, yearly change, percent change, and total volume traded.

The macro also finds the ticker symbols with the highest % change, lowest % change, and highest volume traded.

Three pictures are included, showing the results when run on multi_year_stock_data workbook.
